An AI-powered assistant designed to help users turn messy thoughts into clear, actionable tasks using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. Built with FastAPI, Qdrant for vector search, and Docker for containerization, this system organizes ideas, refines them, and extracts tasks to help with productivity. The project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models for semantic understanding, supporting various inputs from simple thoughts to detailed ideas, with future support for multilingual capabilities.
